We didn't define any UX flow to let users edit a descrption on an existing TODO item.
Which UX flow will you define?
In your response notice the following:
1. how easy is it for users to figure out this flow in their first usage? (for example, a glowing button is more discoverable then a swipe-left gesture)
2. how hard to implement will your solution be?
3. how consistent is this flow with regular "edit" flows in the Android world?
-----------------------------
I would have chosen that a simple tao in any item in the list wouldve oppened up a new window, in
that window the user would have more space to edit the text in the item freely, and more easily.

1. in my opinion this UX flow is the most trivial and its very easy to figure out, maybe adding
    a bit of makeup to our TextView (item) would make it appear more clickable, hence helping the user to
    figure it out.

2. shouldn't be hard at all, finding a background color for the items should be very easy via any
    search engine.
    opening the extra window would take a bit more effort, but also shouldnt be so difficult,
    using broadcast to move data from and to the new activity should be an easy and fun challenge.

3. very consistent, this is how all the to-do apps do it, and it makes sense, sometimes less is more.
